This very simple python script is used to create a site map based on links recursively.

it uses `wget`'s spider method to gather header information recurively on a website root.

NOTE: this can be used as a function to be used for exploit of MS15-034. Specifically data gathering from RAM. 

to be updated with a function for gathering RAM data (in a different repository).

UPDATE: It's gonna be re-written by asyncio
